## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting math scores using a machine learning model. The process involves several steps, including data ingestion, data transformation, creating a pipeline, and building/training a predictive model. The ultimate goal is to provide accurate predictions based on input features related to students' information.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
Installation
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd math-score-prediction
(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Data
The data for this project can be found in the data/ directory. It includes the necessary datasets in CSV format: students.csv and scores.csv. These datasets contain information about students and their math scores.

## Data Ingestion
The data ingestion process involves loading the datasets and preparing them for further processing. You can find the code related to data ingestion in the src/data_ingestion/ directory.

## Data Transformation
Data transformation involves preprocessing, cleaning, and transforming the raw data into a suitable format for modeling. Code related to data transformation can be found in the src/data_transformation/ directory.

## Pipeline
The pipeline combines data ingestion, transformation, and model training into a coherent workflow. You can find the implementation of the pipeline in the src/pipeline/ directory.

## Model Building and Training
The machine learning model is responsible for predicting math scores based on the transformed data. The model implementation resides in the src/model/ directory. You can also find Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory where model experimentation and evaluation have been conducted.

## Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics, which are discussed in the project's Jupyter notebooks. The main evaluation script can be found in the src/model/ directory.

## Usage
To run the entire pipeline and reproduce the results, execute the following command:
## python main.py
